An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood. One day, an outsider named Dream went to the gloomy villager's house, placed some TNT in the house, used a wooden button to light it up, and the house exploded. The wooden planks that used to make up the house was on the floor. Since Dream used a button instead of flint and steel to ignite the TNT and blow up the house, his village rating did not go down. However, the gloomy villager still complained. However, when Dream placed down a fletching table to employ the villager, the dream became a fletcher and was happy. Furthermore, Dream used the wooden planks that he collected to craft a bunch of sticks and traded them with the villager for a bunch of emeralds. Dream used these emeralds to obtain some arrows from the fletcher.
